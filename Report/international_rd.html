<strong><em>” The amplitude of cross-border / overseas R&amp;D operations has dramatically increased over the last two decades. Indeed, products embody a growing number of technologies and components, and are thus becoming increasingly reliant upon an expanding number of specialized fields of knowledge. Therefore, in order to remain competitive, firms must master innovations across a wide range of technology fields and this often requires tapping into different centers of excellence around the world. Following this perspective, internationalization of R&amp;D activities should be seen as a conscious strategy of knowledge seeking companies trying to profit from such globally dispersed reservoirs of knowledge by establishing R&amp;D activities abroad.” <a href = https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/192762856.pdf target = “_blank”>( Moncada-Paternò-Castello et al., 2011, p.2)</a> </em></strong>

<p>Recent research on collaborative patents highlights the role of international knowledge sharing in R&amp;D activities. For instance, according to <a href = https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ecoj.12369 target = “_blank”>Kerr and Kerr (2018)</a>, research projects resulting in patents which are a product of collaboration between multinational research teams yield better innovations than patents where the research is completely done by local scientists, i.e. in the firm’s home country solely. The joint-work on patents between labs in different countries increased rapidly over the last decades and without a shred of doubt will continue to do so. The development of communication and information technologies, coupled with an overall ongoing process of digitization in all spheres of our societies boosted the creation of collaboration networks and diffusion of knowledge. Since this digital revolution is happening at the speed of light, there is always a possibility that some firms, research institutions or even entire countries could soon find themselves lagging behind in terms of the quality of their innovation output. Perhaps this could be prevented by choosing the right partners – those who are at the digital frontier. Furthermore, another important aspect to consider are emerging global events, threatening the very existence of the foundation of international research collaborations – the international movement of scientists. The Covid-19 pandemic, but also political episodes like Brexit and an overall tendency towards bilateralism in shaping relationships between countries, bring a certain dose of uncertainty, possibly affecting the pace of research activities in future. From the perspective of Switzerland as a small, very innovative country it is therefore important to better understand (i) with which countries are r&amp;d collaborations most benefical. And (ii) compare the number of international collaborations among Swiss and other countries’ research teams in order to reveal possible improvements regarding cooperations. g</p>

<div id="defining-collaborative-patents-and-their-quality" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>Defining collaborative patents and their quality</strong></h3>
<p>We use patent data to analyze the effect of collaboration locations on the quality of patents. Our data consist of patents registered at the US Patent Office and are taken from <a href = https://www.patentsview.org/download/ target = “_blank”>patentsview.org</a>. We proxy the quality of a patent by the number of citations it received over the period of 5 years since its publication. More specifically, we create a patent quality indicator variable which equals 1 if a patent is among the top ten percent of received forward citations within the first 5 years after publication for a given technology and publication year and 0 otherwise. In addition, each patent contains information on inventors’ and assignees’ (one or more firms which are patent owners) countries of residence, enabling us to geographically classify patents and determine whether they are collaborative in their nature. Given that patents may have more than one legal owner, we restrict our sample to those patents that have only one assignee. Otherwise, it cannot be properly determined whether there is international collaboration within a (or among) research team(s). By losing a small portion of observations (the majority of patents have only one legal owner), we gain the opportunity to pin point a single country as the patent’s home nation. Further, we restrict our sample to include patents published between 1990 and 2015. We set 1990 as the start because the internationalization of R&amp;D activities only began to evolve rapidly in the early 90s. The year of 2015 is set as the end period of our sample as it is often shown in the literature that patents receive most of their citations within the first five years of their life and our quality indicator (based on patents’ received citations) is calculated on a 5-year basis, thus we cannot include years after 2015. Finally, we also drop patents whose legal owner is located in the USA. This is done to prevent a strong bias towards non-collaborative patents driven by the US based assignee firms as more than 90% of their inventors have a residency in the USA. Some repercussions of our sampling decisions are discussed in detail in a separate file on robustness checks, data and methodology that can be found HERE.<br />
We define collaborative patents as patents where at least one of its inventors is located abroad, i.e. if at least one of inventor’s country of residence does not match the residence of patent’s assignee. Therefore, patents that have all inventors located in a country matching the residence country of an assignee are non-collaborative (in international terms) and will serve as a reference group to contrast the effects of collaboration on the quality of patents</p>
<p><br> ### <strong>International collaboration and patent’s quality</strong> Our goal is to discover whetherinternational collaborations are associated with innovations of higher quality. In addition, we would also like to investigate how this relationship depends on the partnering country. . Hence, we estimate a linear probability model where the dependent variable is our previously described quality indicator. We also control for additional factors that may impact the patent’s quality, closely following <a href = https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ecoj.12369 target = “_blank”>Kerr and Kerr (2018)</a>. In particular, we use the number of inventors, a variable capturing the originality of an invention and the number of claims. We also introduce a set of time, owner’s country and technology field’s specific fixed effects to account for unobservable factors affecting collaboration and citations of a patent. More importantly, we introduce a set of country dummies representing locations of foreign inventors. These are our coefficients of interest to measure whether to cooperate with a particular partner country is (on average) associated with patents of higher quality relative to patents exclusively created at home locations (ie, all inventors reside in the same country as the legal owner). For a more detailed description about our model please see the separate file on robustness checks, data and methodology.</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>How does a collaboration with specific countries affect the quality of a patent? Figure 1 tries to answer this question by plotting the estimated coefficients from our model that measures the probability of a patent being among the top 10% most cited patents depending on different collaboration locations along with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals. The effects for specific technological fields are also estimated and the user can choose a specific mix of results across partner countries and technologies by making selections in the two drop down menus above Figure 1. In general, our findings suggest that only a collaboration with the USA and Great Britain has a positive effect on a patent’s quality. Research collaborations linked to the development of a patent with countries other than the USA or Great Britain has no effect on the patent’s probability of becoming a world-class (top cited) invention. These estimates refer to average effects across all technological fields of patents. However, differentiating across technologies, we notice that there is some heterogeneity related to the partner country. In doing so, we use the most aggregated technology classification of the &lt;a href = <a href="https://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/ipstats/en/statistics/patents/pdf/wipo_ipc_technology.pdftarget" class="uri">https://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/ipstats/en/statistics/patents/pdf/wipo_ipc_technology.pdftarget</a> = “_blank”&gt;WIPO</a> You can investigate the results by choosing the particular technology in the above selection field. Accordingly, performing R&amp;D activities in the field of mechanical engineering in collaboration with a research site in Ireland increases a firm’s chance of producing top innovation the most (nearly 10%) compared to purely domestic patents. For Chemistry this is Korea (nearly 5%), for electrical engineering this is the US (nearly 4%), for instruments this is Singapore (nearly 5%) and finally for inventions belonging to the other fields category this is again the US (slightly above 5%). It is interesting to note that to cooperate with a Swiss research facility in doing R&amp;D in the field of mechanical engineering increases the probability of a patent becoming a top innovation by around 2.5% and is among the highest in the world in this field. Cooperations in other technological fields seems to have no effect on the quality of patents when a foreign firm conducts at least some parts of its R&amp;D in Switzerland. Furthermore, the estimates suggest that R&amp;D activities of foreign firms in the USA or Great Britain is associated with higher quality in almost all technological fields, making these two locations the most desirable partner countries when it comes to patent development.<br />

<h3><strong>International collaboration and the quality of innovation</strong></h3>
<p><br></p>
<p>Now that we know with which locations it is beneficial to collaborate in order to increase the chance of high-quality innovations, we turn our attention to collaboration trends of Swiss firms. We calculate the shares of inventors’ countries of residence in the total number of inventors that participated in creating Swiss firms’ patents. These locational shares are calculated for each 5-year period interval between 1990 and 2015, for each country of residence and across technological fields.

<h4><strong>Figure 2: Locations of Swiss patents’ inventors </strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:0.8em">*Source: CIEB’s own calculations based on data from the <a href=https://www.patentsview.org/download/ target = “_blank”>USPTO</a>.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As the above Figure 2 shows, in the last 25 years, Swiss firms have substantially increased the amount of R&amp;D activities performed abroad. Hence, international collaboration plays an important role in the development of Swiss patents. The increase in collaboration with foreign research sites is dominantly driven by the rising numbers of inventors residing in the USA, who make 19% of all inventors by the end of 2015. As expected, other common locations of Swiss patents’ inventors are neighboring countries, but also locations in Sweden, Great Britain and the Netherlands. Observing the share of inventors’ locations across technological fields reveals that there is not much deviation from average figures trends, with some rare exceptions. Nonetheless, it is worth mentioning that in the field of chemistry (which includes pharmaceuticals) and instruments the share of inventors residing in the USA went up as high as 23%. According to our estimations in Figure 1, this increasing cooperation of Swiss firms with US based inventors across all fields is more than justified, given that such patents have a particularly higher chance of becoming top inventions. However, even though placed as the 4th most important location of Swiss patent inventors’, it seems that R&amp;D of Swiss firms in Britian has much room for improvement. Our estimates revealed that Great Britain is the only other location apart from the US which increases the chance of developing a top innovation. After Brexit, both the USA and Great Britain fall into the category of “third countries”, subject to a stricter migration regime. On the one hand, this represents a threat to Swiss firms’ R&amp;D activities in Britain., But on the other hand, it also suggests that there might be some room for regulatory enhancements that could be utilized by policy makers in Switzerland. In our next section, we discuss these issues.</p>

<h3><strong>Policy implications</strong></h3>

<strong><em>” One of the consequences of Brexit is that the bilateral Agreement on the Free Movements of Persons between Switzerland and the EU no longer applies to the UK as from 1st January 2021. UK nationals are as a result no longer regarded as EU/EFTA nationals but as “third-country” citizens, who are subject to stricter admission requirements for residence purposes in Switzerland.” <a href = https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=46c0c88f-eb1e-4c77-bc93-3d3f554ed973 target = “_blank”>(Tron and Metaxas in Lexology, 2021)</a> </em></strong>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p><br></p>
<p>It seems that Swiss firms already have an established cooperation network with inventors/research sites from countries that produce the largest benefits for the quality of inventions - USA and Great Britain. Nevertheless, based on our analysis, it is not possible to interfere whether certain relaxations of migration laws and procedures could have led to even more numerous collaborations between Swiss-located inventors, on the one side and US or British inventors on the other side, and ultimately to even higher quality of innovations of Swiss firms.</p>
<p>Regarding Swiss’ international economic policy, one important goal should be to ensure the best possible conditions for international collaborations to take place. In the context of this report, this would foremost imply frictionlessmobility of high-skilled labor between countries, especially with those whose “reservoirs of knowledge” may produce the largest gains for the Swiss economy. Hence, with regard to R&amp;D policy, our empirical analysis implies that Swiss policy makers should have a particular focus on sound bilateral relations with the USA and Great Britain. For instance, the fact that Great Britain left the EU and that Swiss R&amp;D-cooperations with British experts is very important, the issue of researchers’ mobility has become extremely relevant. For example, back in 2019, academics were very worried: “Scientific progress in Switzerland, and for Swiss citizens, could be at risk if research and innovation are caught up in the politics of Brexit, say those affected in the Swiss and British research communities” (<a href = https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/-toxic-uncertainty--for-swiss-and-uk-scientists-ahead-of-brexit/44737510 target = “_blank”>Giroud in Swissinfo, 2019</a>). Although academic research is not exactly the same as firm R&amp;D, this concern should also be relevant there. As of 1st of January 2021, UK nationals are considered as “third-country” citizens and, as such, are subject to harsher migration procedures. For instance, UK nationals who want to live and work in Switzerland now have to apply for a residence permit following under the same conditions like for other “third-country” foreigners. But shorter stays for business purposes (up to 90 days) will, however, be possible under the same conditions as for Europeans under the signed Service Mobility Agreement which will stay in power until the end of 2022 (<a href = https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=46c0c88f-eb1e-4c77-bc93-3d3f554ed973 target = “_blank”>Tron and Metaxas in Lexology, 2021</a>). Hence, based on our results, it is extremely important to extend this agreement regulating short-stays significantly into the future and perhaps even negotiate a new bilateral agreement that will give a special status (similar to the pre-Brexit one) to Swiss and UK nationals seeking a permanent residence to work in a research intensive field. A similar bilateral agreement could be negotiated with the USA as well. Such agreements would avoid any uncertainty related to researchers and developers’ mobility and potentially benefit the innovation landscape of Switzerland in the long run.</p>
