    | Tooltips can be
    span.TooltipTrigger(data-tooltips="Attached", data-position="OnTop") attached
    |
    | to any element. When you hover the
    span.TooltipTrigger(
      data-tooltips="Element to something",
      data-position="OnBottom"
    ) element
    |
    | with your mouse, the title attribute is displayed in
    span.TooltipTrigger(
      data-tooltips="A little box to something to make it longer",
      data-position="OnLeft"
    ) a little box
    |
    | next to the element, just like a native tooltip. But as it's not a native tooltip, it can be styled. Any themes built with
    span.TooltipTrigger(
      data-tooltips="Theme Roller to something",
      data-position="OnRight"
    ) ThemeRoller
    |
    | will also style tooltips accordingly. Tooltips are also useful for form elements, to show some additional information in the context of each field.
