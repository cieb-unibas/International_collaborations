<blockquote>***”The amplitude of cross-border / overseas R&D operations has dramatically increased over the last two decades. Indeed, products embody a growing number of technologies and components, and are thus becoming increasingly reliant upon an expanding number of specialized fields of knowledge. Therefore, in order to remain competitive, firms must master innovations across a wide range of technology fields and this often requires tapping into different centers of excellence around the world.

Joint research between labs of different countries has increased rapidly over the last decades and, without a shred of doubt, will continue to do so. The development of communication and information technologies, coupled with an ongoing process of digitization in all spheres of our societies has not only boosted the creation of collaboration networks, but also the diffusion of knowledge. Since this digital revolution is happening at the speed of light, there is always a possibility that some firms, research institutions, or even entire countries could soon find themselves lagging behind in terms of the quality of their innovation output. Choosing the right partners – those who are at the digital frontier - could prevent this.  Indeed, recent research highlights the role of international knowledge-sharing in R&D activities. For instance, <a href = https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ecoj.12369 target = “_blank”>Kerr and Kerr (2018)</a> investigated the quality of patented research projects. They found that patents which were developed jointly by multinational research teams yield better innovations, compared to patents where the research is done completely by local scientists (i.e., solely in the firm’s home country). 
Unfortunately, <a href = https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ecoj.12369 target = “_blank”>Kerr and Kerr (2018)</a> do not analyze whether the benefits of collaborative international research depends on who the partner country is. This, however, is important where targeted policy recommendations are concerned, especially for a small, open and highly innovative country like Switzerland, which depends greatly on the exchange of ideas across national borders. And such a targeted policy is likely to become all the more important as some emerging global events are threatening the very foundation of collaboration in international research  – the international movement of scientists. For instance, the Covid-19 pandemic brings a certain dose of uncertainty among firms and research institutions, possibly affecting the pace of future research activities. This is also true for political episodes like Brexit and an overall tendency towards bilateralism in shaping relationships between countries.
In light of these developments, sound evidence is important to prioritize with whom to foster bilateral agreements designed to promote the exchange of knowledge in any form. In this report, we tackle exactly these enquiries and generate some valuable implications for Swiss policy-makers. 

<br>

### **Defining collaborative innovations and their quality**

We use patent data to analyze how different collaboration locations affect the quality of innovations. Our data consist of patents registered at the US Patent Office and are taken from <a href = https://www.patentsview.org target = “_blank”>patentsview.org</a>. We proxy the quality of an innovation by the number of citations a patent has received over the period of 5 years since its publication. More specifically, we create a patent quality-indicator variable, which equals 1 if a patent is among the top ten percent of the most cited patents (received forward citations) within the first 5 years after publication for a given technology and publication year, and 0 otherwise. Previous studies have shown that the number of forward citations that a patent receives is positively correlated with its technological impact and overall economic value (<a href = https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/132/2/665/3076284 target = “_blank”>Kogan et al., 2017</a>; <a href = https://www.jstor.org/stable/1593752?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents target = “_blank”>Hall et al., 2005</a>). Thus, forward citations have become an established indicator of the quality of innovations written down in patents in recent years (e.g. <a href = https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733321000196 target = “_blank”>Higham et al., 2021</a>; <a href = https://www.bertelsmann-stiftung.de/de/publikationen/publikation/did/weltklassepatente-in-zukunftstechnologien target = “_blank”>Bertelsmann Foundation, 2020</a>) and we follow these insights.   

In addition, each patent contains information on the countries of residence of inventors and assignees (mostly one or more firms which are patent owners). This enables us to classify patents geographically and determine whether they are internationally collaborative in their nature. Further, we restrict our sample to include patents published between 1990 and 2015. 
We define “internationally collaborative patents” as patents where at least one of its inventors is located abroad, i.e., if the country of residence of at least one of the inventors does not match the residence of the patent’s assignee. Therefore, patents, all of whose inventors are located in a country matching the residence country of the assignee are non-collaborative (in international terms) and will serve as a reference group to contrast the effects of collaboration on the quality of innovations codified by patents. A detailed description of our data-processing steps can be found in our separate file, <a href = https://innoscape.de/internat_collab/Appendix_International_Collaboration.pdf target = “_blank”> robustness checks, data and methodology</a>.

### **International collaboration and the quality of innovation**

Our goal is to discover whether international R&D collaboration is associated with innovations of higher quality. In addition, we would also like to investigate how this relationship depends on who the partnering country is. Hence, we estimate a linear probability model where the dependent variable is our previously described quality indicator. We also control for additional factors that may impact the patent’s quality, closely following <a href = https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ecoj.12369 target = “_blank”>Kerr and Kerr (2018)</a>. In particular, we use the number of inventors, a variable capturing the originality of an invention and the number of claims. We also introduce a set of time, the assignee’s country and the specific fixed effects of the technology field to account for unobservable factors affecting collaboration and citations of a patent. Additionally and more importantly, we introduce a set of country dummies representing locations of foreign inventors.  These are our coefficients of interest to measure whether cooperating with a particular partner country is (on average) associated with innovations of higher quality, relative to innovations exclusively created at home locations (i.e., if all inventors reside in the same country as the legal owner). For a more detailed description of our model, please see our separate file <a href = https://innoscape.de/internat_collab/Appendix_International_Collaboration.pdf target = “_blank”> robustness checks, data and methodology</a>.

<span style="font-size:0.8em">*Source and notes: CIEB’s own calculations based on data from the <a href = https://www.patentsview.org target = “_blank”>USPTO</a>. The horizontal bar plots show the corresponding 95% confidence interval. If the lower bound is above zero, the corresponding coefficient is significantly positive at the 95% level or higher. If the upper bound is below zero, the coefficient is significantly negative at the 95% level or higher. A positive coefficient means that partnering with the respective country is associated with innovations of better quality than solely domestic innovations. A negative coefficient means the opposite.*</span>

<br>

How does collaboration with specific countries affect the quality of a patent? Figure 1 tries to answer this question by plotting the estimated coefficients. They show how collaboration with a specific partner country influences the probability of obtaining a patent among the top 10% most cited patents, in comparison with solely domestic innovations. Coefficients whose 95% confidence interval is located in the positive range (to the right of the zero line) indicate instances of international collaboration that lead (on average) to significantly better innovations, compared to homegrown innovations. The opposite is the case for coefficients having a confidence interval in the negative sphere (to the left of the zero line). If a coefficient’s confidence interval overlaps with the zero line, this means that the effect on the quality of innovation of partnering with that particular country is not statistically different from purely domestic patents. The effects for specific technological fields are also estimated and the user can choose a specific mix of results across partner countries and technologies by making selections in the two drop-down menus above Figure 1. 

In general, our findings suggest that collaboration with only the USA or Great Britain has a positive effect on the quality of an innovation. Collaborative research with countries other than the USA or Great Britain shows no effect on a patent’s probability of becoming a world-class (top-cited) invention. These estimates refer to average effects across all technological patent fields. However, by differentiating across technologies, we notice that there is some heterogeneity related to the partner country’s effects. In doing so, we use the most aggregated technology classification of the <a href=https://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/ipstats/en/statistics/patents/pdf/wipo_ipc_technology.pdf target = “_blank”>WIPO</a>. You can investigate the results by choosing the particular technology in the above selection field. 
It is interesting to note that in the field of mechanical engineering, cooperating with a Swiss research facility increases the probability of developing a top innovation by around 2.5%. This is among the highest in the world in this field. Cooperation in other technological fields seems to have no effect on the quality of an innovation when a foreign firm conducts at least some parts of its R&D in Switzerland. Furthermore, the estimates suggest that foreign firms with research sites in (or collaboration with) the USA or Great Britain are associated with better innovations in almost all technological fields, making these two locations the most desirable partner countries when it comes to R&D activities.    

<br>
          
### **International R&D collaboration of Swiss firms**

Now that we have an impression with which locations it seems most beneficial to collaborate in order to increase the chance of high-quality innovations, we turn our attention to collaboration trends of Swiss firms. To do this, we calculate the share of inventors’ countries of residence with the total number of inventors who participated in creating Swiss patents (owned by firms with residence in Switzerland). These locational shares are calculated for each 5-year interval between 1990 and 2015, for each country of residence and across different technological fields. Users may choose / add multiple technological fields and start the animation showing trends through the period.

<span style="font-size:0.8em">*Source: CIEB’s own calculations based on data from the <a href=https://www.patentsview.org target = “_blank”>USPTO</a>. The figure shows the number of inventors of the respective partner country to the total number of inventors for Swiss-based firms.*</span>

<br>

As Figure 2 above shows, in the last 25 years, Swiss based firms have substantially increased the number of R&D activities performed abroad. Hence, international collaboration plays an important role in the development of patents in Switzerland. The increase in collaboration with foreign research sites is predominantly driven by the rising numbers of inventors residing in the USA. By the end of 2015, 19% of all inventors who were involved in the development of patents by Swiss-based companies are from the USA. As expected, Swiss patent inventors are also commonly located in neighboring countries, but there are also locations in Sweden, Great Britain and the Netherlands. 

<div class=bloc_div>
<blockquote>***19% of all inventors stated on patents developed by Swiss-based companies reside in the USA***</blockquote>
</div>

Observing the share of inventors’ locations across technological fields reveals that there is not much deviation from the trends of the average figures, with some rare exceptions. Nonetheless, it is worth mentioning that in the field of chemistry (which includes pharmaceuticals) and instruments, the share of inventors residing in the USA has gone as high as 23%. According to our estimations in Figure 1, this increasing cooperation of Swiss firms with US-based inventors across all fields is more than justified, given that such patents have a particularly high chance of becoming top inventions. 

However, even though placed as the 4th most important location of Swiss patent inventors, it seems there is much room for improvement with regard to R&D of Swiss firms in Britain. Our estimates revealed that Great Britain is the only other location apart from the US with which collaboration increases the chance of developing a top innovation. After Brexit, both the USA and Great Britain fall into the category of “third countries”, subject to a stricter migration regime. On the one hand, this represents a threat to the R&D activities of Swiss firms in Britain. But on the other hand, it also suggests that there might be some room for regulatory enhancements that could be utilized by policy-makers in Switzerland. In our next section, we discuss these issues.    

<br>


### **Policy implications**

As the previous results show, it seems that Swiss firms already have an established cooperation network with inventors/research sites from countries that are associated with the greatest benefits regarding the quality of inventions - USA and Great Britain. Nevertheless, based on our analysis, it is not possible to infer whether certain relaxations of migration laws and procedures could have led to even more numerous instances of collaboration between Swiss-located inventors, on the one side and US or British inventors on the other, and ultimately to an even higher quality of innovations of Swiss-based firms. 

<div class=bloc_div>

UK nationals are as a result no longer regarded as EU/EFTA nationals but as “third-country” citizens, who are subject to stricter admission requirements for residence purposes in Switzerland.”

Regarding Swiss innovation policy, one important goal should be to ensure that the best possible conditions for international collaboration take place. In the context of this report, this would foremost imply frictionless mobility of high-skilled labor between countries, especially with those whose “reservoirs of knowledge” may produce the largest gains for the Swiss economy. Hence, with regard to R&D activities, our empirical analysis implies that Swiss policy makers should have a particular focus on sound bilateral relations with the USA and Great Britain.

For instance, the fact that Great Britain left the EU and that Swiss R&D-cooperation with British experts is very important, the issue of researchers’ mobility has become extremely relevant. For example, back in 2019, academics were very worried: “Scientific progress in Switzerland, and for Swiss citizens, could be at risk if research and innovation are caught up in the politics of Brexit,” say those affected in the Swiss and British research communities (<a href = https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/-toxic-uncertainty--for-swiss-and-uk-scientists-ahead-of-brexit/44737510 target = “_blank”>Giroud in Swissinfo, 2019</a>). Although academic research is not exactly the same as firm R&D, this concern should also be relevant here. As of January 1st, 2021, UK nationals are considered “third-country” citizens and, as such, are subject to harsher migration procedures. For instance, UK nationals who want to live and work in Switzerland now have to apply for a residence permit following the same conditions as for other “third-country” foreigners. But shorter stays for business purposes (up to 90 days) will, however, be possible under the same conditions as for Europeans under the signed Service Mobility Agreement which will be enforced until the end of 2022 (<a href = https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=46c0c88f-eb1e-4c77-bc93-3d3f554ed973 target = “_blank”>Tron and Metaxas in Lexology, 2021</a>). Hence, based on our results, it is extremely important to extend this agreement regulating short stays significantly into the future and perhaps even to negotiate a new bilateral agreement that will give a special status (similar to the pre-Brexit one) to Swiss and UK nationals seeking permanent residence to work in a research-intensive field. A similar bilateral agreement could be negotiated with the USA as well. Such agreements would avoid any uncertainty related to the mobility of researchers and developers and potentially benefit the innovation landscape of Switzerland in the long run.
